"""Segment a combined "Full Application" PDF into sections — local, no LLM.

Admissions exports bundle each student's resume, statement of purpose, letters,
score cards, transcripts — and sometimes an entire thesis — into ONE PDF. We
label every page with the section it belongs to, then keep resume / SOP / LOR /
scores and drop forms, boilerplate and thesis/appendix material.

Approach (a small, deterministic sequence labeler — no LLM, no network):

  1. **Per-page emission scores.** Each page is scored *independently* for every
     candidate label (resume, sop, lor, scores, ignore) from a bundle of
     features: heading phrases, a contact block, first-person prose density,
     LOR/reference form fields, score-report & transcript cues, and
     form/thesis/math detectors. No page inherits a label just because of its
     neighbour.
  2. **Viterbi decode.** The page labels are decoded jointly with transition
     penalties, so sections come out as contiguous blocks and a stray page can't
     flip the surrounding section — but a score card or form *can* interrupt a
     run cheaply. This replaces the old "carry the previous label forward" rule,
     which dumped theses and form pages into whatever section preceded them.

It still reports what it found and flags low confidence rather than pretending to
be exact.
